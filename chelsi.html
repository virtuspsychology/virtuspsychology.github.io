      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <br>
      <span class="italics">Do I need a referral?</span><br>
No, you do not need a referral. You are welcome to self-refer (make an appointment without a referral from a GP or a mental health treatment plan). Self-referred clients pay the full fee without a Medicare rebate, this may be able to be claimed through private health insurance depending on your insurance coverage.
<br><br>
<span class="italics">Fees and Medicare Rebate</span><br>
Appointments are payable on the day, and a rebate is then processed through Medicare. If you have a MHTP and valid referral you are currently entitled to Medicare rebates for up to 10 individual psychology appointments per calendar year. Your GP will generally refer you for an initial six sessions, after which Chelsi will write to your GP to provide feedback on your progress. You will be required to return to your GP who will assess whether they can then refer you for a further four sessions.
<br><br>
<span class="italics">What is required for me to obtain the Medicare rebate?</span><br>
To be eligible for a Medicare rebate, you must have a valid referral from a GP. This requires completing a Mental Health Treatment Plan (MHTP) (previously known as a mental health care plan) with your doctor. If youâ€™d like to get a referral and a MHTP please book a long appointment with your GP who will discuss your eligibility.
<br><br>

<span class="italics">What if my referral runs out, or I cannot get a new referral in time for my appointment?</span><br>
If you are unable to get a new referral in time for your next appointment with Chelsi, you can still attend the appointment but will be unable to claim a Medicare rebate.
<br><br>

<span class="italics">How many sessions will I need and how often are they?</span><br>
This can be discussed with Chelsi at your initial appointment; however the number of sessions and frequency is largely dependent on what you are experiencing and what you would like to achieve from sessions. Some people come to see a psychologist for a one-off session or to discuss a very specific concern which may only require a short treatment period (e.g. less than six sessions). Other people may come to address long-standing issues that may have developed from experiences in their childhood or from significant stressors, or to have ongoing support. This type of therapy generally occurs over an extended period of time.
