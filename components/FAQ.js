    <span class="question">What can I expect from therapy?</span>
    <br><br>
    Therapy will involve working collaboratively with your psychologist over the course of several 55 minute sessions. Your psychologist
    is an expert on evidence-based treatments and interventions, and you are an expert on the factors in your own life, what you have tried before,
    what has/hasn't worked, and your own goals and values. You may discuss the problems you are having in your life, learn and/or practice
    various skills, experiment with different ways of thinking and/or behaving, and develop greater insight into yourself or others.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">What will happen at the first session?</span>
    <br><br>
    During the first session, your psychologist will ask you questions about your current goals and life factors. Your psychologist will ask about any
    medication or medical conditions, suicidal thoughts, or psychotic symptoms - all clients are asked these questions, due to the critical impact they
    may have on outcomes.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">How will progress be measured?</span>
    <br><br>
    At the start of therapy (either before, shortly after, or during your first session), you will be asked to complete a Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale.
    This is a standardised, objective measure of the frequency and severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general stress. After several sessions, you
    will be asked to complete this scale again, and the results will be compared. You and your psychologist will reflect on the comparison, and identify the factors
    which have contributed to any increase or decrease in the frequency or severity of symptoms.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">Is all therapy the same?</span>
    <br><br>
    It is not! Psychologists can differ greatly in their level of knowledge, experience, training, their personal beliefs, interpersonal skills, theoretical framework,
    social/economic/cultural background, and many other ways which may have an impact on how engaging they are to you, and how helpful you find their approach.
    Some clients may benefit more or less from certain psychologists than they do from others, and this can vary depending on the person. It is important to remember
    this, as any negative or unhelpful experiences you or others may have had with therapy does not mean that all therapy will be of equal value to you.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">How much do you charge?</span>
    <br><br>
    In line with the APS recommended schedule of fees for sessions with a private practice psychologist, a 60 minute session will cost $260.
    If you have a Mental Health Treatment Plan, you will be eligible for a rebate of $88.25.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">What if I can't afford that rate?</span>
    <br><br>
    Session frequency can be adjusted from weekly to fortnightly, monthly, or any length you prefer, to spread the financial impact of sessions over time.
    It is also important to be aware of what other psychologists are charging, as there may be some who charge less than the recommended rate.
    Additionally, there are low-cost mental health services such as:<ul>

    <span class="question">What if I need to cancel?</span>
    <br><br>
    When cancelling a booked session with less than 24 hour's notice, the full session fee will be charged.
    When cancelling a booked session with 24 to 48 hour's notice, 50% of the session fee will be charged.
    These fees will not be eligible for a Medicare rebate.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">What is a mental health treatment plan? How does it work?</span>
    <br><br>
    A mental health treatment plan is a plan that you create with your doctor, aimed at improving your mental health. This plan may involve sessions with a psychologist, in
    which case Medicare will provide financial assistance towards these sessions. If you are unsure whether you have or need a mental health treatment plan, or whether you
    can expect Medicare rebates from sessions with a psychologist, speak to your GP.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">Is my information private?</span>
    <br><br>
    Your psychologist will take notes on the things you discuss in your sessions. This information is encrypted with the same level of security that a bank uses, and
    stored on a server. Only your psychologist will be able to access this information. Your psychologist will not share your information with anyone unless:<ul>
    <li>You give consent for this information to be shared (e.g. to a GP or other health professional)</li>
    <li>Your psychologist has reason to believe that you or someone else will be harmed if they do not disclose information. In this case, your psychologist will adopt
    a harm minimisation approach, and take the course of action they deem justifiable</li>
    <li>Your psychologist is legally required to disclose information, e.g. when subpoenaed</li></ul><br>
    In all cases, your psychologist will value your privacy and dignity. Additionally, your psychologist may share de-identified/anonymised information with supervisors
    or peers for the sole purpose of improving your treatment.
