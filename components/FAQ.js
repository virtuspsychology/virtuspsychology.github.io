    <span class="question">How much do you charge?</span>

    <span class="question">What is a mental health treatment plan? How does it work?</span>
    <br><br>
    A mental health treatment plan is a plan that you create with your doctor, aimed at improving your mental health. This plan may involve sessions with a psychologist, in
    which case Medicare will provide financial assistance towards these sessions. If you are unsure whether you have or need a mental health treatment plan, or whether you
    can expect Medicare rebates from sessions with a psychologist, speak to your GP.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">Is all therapy the same?</span>
    <br><br>
    It is not! Psychologists can differ greatly in their level of knowledge, experience, training, their personal beliefs, interpersonal skills, theoretical framework,
    social/economic/cultural background, and many other ways which may have an impact on how engaging they are to you, and how helpful you find their approach.
    Some clients may benefit more or less from certain psychologists than they do from others, and this can vary depending on the person. It is important to remember
    this, as any negative or unhelpful experiences you or others may have had with therapy does not mean that all therapy will be of equal value to you.
    <br><br>
    <span class="question">Is my information private?</span>
    <br><br>
    Your psychologist will take notes on the things you discuss in your sessions. This information is encrypted with the same level of security that a bank uses, and
    stored on a server. Only your psychologist will be able to access this information. Your psychologist will not share your information with anyone unless:<ul>
    <li>You give consent for this information to be shared (e.g. to a GP or other health professional)</li>
    <li>Your psychologist has reason to believe that you or someone else will be harmed if they do not disclose information. In this case, your psychologist will adopt
    a harm minimisation approach, and take the course of action they deem justifiable</li>
    <li>Your psychologist is legally required to disclose information, e.g. when subpoenaed</li></ul><br>
    In all cases, your psychologist will value your privacy and dignity. Additionally, your psychologist may share de-identified/anonymised information with supervisors
    or peers for the sole purpose of improving your treatment.
