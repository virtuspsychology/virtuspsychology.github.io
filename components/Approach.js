    My approach to therapy involves curiously and compassionately exploring conscious and unconscious
    beliefs, emotions, behaviours, and intuitions about ourselves and the world. I believe that a certain
    amount of sadness, or anxiety, or anger, is tolerable and gives us important imformation about
    our environment.
    I also believe that feeling distressed about the level of negative emotions we are
    experiencing points to a subconscious
    internal conflict. Negative emotions aren't things which are external to us - we have evolved to
    experience negative emotions, because they can help to keep us safe. However, sometimes beliefs,
    emotions, or coping stretegies become "frozen in time", and persist when they are no longer needed.
    This is natural, too; if something is keeping you safe, it makes sense to keep it around, even if it's
    not actually needed anymore - just in case it is.

    Through my training, research, experience, and reflections, I have noticed a few components which are
    useful for therapeutic change. Most successful therapeutic paradigms include at least one of these components,
    and many components are present, under different names, in many therapeutic paradigms. 
    Some of these components may already be present for you, and so the importance of each varies from person to person.
    I would like to continually update and refine this list, but for now, the components I have noticed are
    discussed in subsequent paragraphs.

    The more important an interpretation feels to survival, the more your mind "fuses" with it
    - the more it is accepted as unquestioningly true. Fusion with thoughts is pretty useful if you are
    in immediate physical danger and need to react. You don't want to waste time wondering whether the
    danger is actually real. When there are longer-term patterns of interpretation, though, it can be
    useful to be aware of the pattern, and question the truthfulness of it.
    <br><br>
    Understanding, accepting, or finding gratitude for whichever internal process is generating negative emotions, thoughts, or behaviours.
    <ul>
    <li>
    If you are anxious, the anxiety is there to keep you safe by finding every possible source of
    danger, and bringing your attention to it.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are angry, the anger is there to find every possible injustice you may be enduring, and give you
    the energy to improve your situation.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are sad, the sadness is there to prevent you from doing anything which might bring on another loss,
    and to think back over what has happened to find every possible thing you may have done which led to the loss.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you have a strong inner critic, the critic is there to make sure you meet a specific standard
    - it will punish you, to avoid you being punished by others.
    </li>
    These processes do their job exceptionally well. This doesn't mean that everything they present to you
    is truthful, but their goal is to protect you.
    If you are compelled to addiction, eating disorders, manipulation, deceitfulness, impulsivity,
    self-harm, shame, self-sacrifice, or judgement, these internal processes are trying to
    protect you from something, whether or not you need protecting.
    <br><br>
    Once you have a clear picture of the interplay of your conscious and unconscious beliefs, emotions,
    intuitions, and protective instincts, you are in a better place to decide how you would like things to
    be. Sometimes this involves identifying various situations and coming up with alternative behaviours.
    Sometimes this isn't enough to improve your quality of life, due to the neural pathway reward circuits
    either being too strong, or involving a distressing experience that is avoided, or being related to a
    situation which doesn't really occur very frequently and you don't have much of an opportunity to
    change your neural networks. If this is the case, the best thing I have found is imagery rescripting.
    Activating the memories which created the protective instincts in the first place by vividly imagining
    them, and changing them by imagining yourself as an adult, stepping in to either protect the younger
    version of yourself, or give them the resources to protect themselves (whichever makes more sense
    in the specific scenario). There is evidence at a physical level that by activating the memory in this
    way, it is possible to change the memory, and the subsequent protective instincts which are triggered by
    similar scenariod.
    <br><br>
    This all takes time, so some kind of awareness of what is going on is needed, to continue down the right
    track. This can be in the form of mindfulness (improving overall awareness), or some sort of journal
    or monitoring (improving specific awareness).
