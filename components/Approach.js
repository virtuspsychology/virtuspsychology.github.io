    When we are young, we start to form beliefs about ourselves and the world. We do this even before
    we can speak, and so some of these beliefs will be "non-verbal" - something you have never put into
    words before, but still believe. Since we are young, we don't have enough knowledge or experience
    to put things into context.
    <br><br>
    <span class="italics">
    Was this person mean to me because people are mean to everyone?
    Or was it because this person is mean to everyone? Or was it because everyone is mean to me? Or
    perhaps this person was being nice, but I am just so sensitive that I had a bad reaction?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    Once these beliefs are formed, our brains go to work on framing incoming experiences in line
    with those beliefs.
    <br><br>
    <span class="italics">
    If a person is nice to me, it means they are just a nice person, or they want
    something from me. If they are mean to me, it's because I deserve it.
    </span>

    Not only does our brain frame things for us, it also picks what to focus on and remember. For
    example, if there is a tiger in the room, we are not going to be focusing on whether the
    air-conditioning is turned on. Typically, our brains choose to filter out things which don't fit
    with our core beliefs. At the same time, we have emotion-congruent memory, which means that it's
    much easier to remember times when we felt the way we feel right now - if you're feeling sad,
    it's much easier to remember other times you've felt sad than it is to remember times you've
    felt happy.
    <br><br>
    As such, if we start out with some negative core beliefs about ourselves or the world, we usually
    end up keeping them. Not only does our brain do a lot of subconscious work to keep those beleifs
    in-tact, but we also tend to behave in ways which maintain these beliefs. People with anxiety
    tend to avoid the things they are anxious of, which means they never get to learn that the 
    source of their anxiety is safer than anticipated, or that their subconscious prediction is not accurate.
    <br><br>
    How does all of this happen?
    <br><br>
    There is a network of brain regions called the Default Mode Network (DMN). The DMN is typically
    active when a person is engaged with the content of internal thoughts. This includes ruminating
    about yourself, your current emotional state, others, the past, or the future. It also includes
    making judgements, social reasoning, and comprehending a narrative. The DMN has been shown to be
    responsible for "top-down" processing, which is the filtering of incoming information to match
    our beliefs - comprehending our narrative.
    <br><br>
    People who suffered from PTSD and then recovered from it show changes in their DMN - their narrative
    has been changed. Activity in the DNM is different between people who suffer from mood disorders
    and people who don't.
    <br><br>
    Taking a closer look at how the DMN works, it has feedback loops which maintain its current pattern
    of activity - meaning that a person who sees themselves as unloveable, or sees the world as a dangerous
    place, will usually continue to see it in that way. The DMN's feedback loops are so strong that it
    is not affected by 


    Internal conflicts can arise in all sorts of situations. Let's say you like ice-cream, but the cashier at
    the ice-cream store is unpleasant to you. There is a specific set of neurons in your reward circuit which
    is driving you towards the ice-cream store, and a (different) specific set of neurons driving you
    away from the store. So, a part of your brain wants one thing, and another part wants another thing.
    No matter what you do, there will be a dopamine shortfall in at least one region of your reward circuit.
    <br><br>
    We evolved emotions because they help motivate our behaviour towards what we need for survival. 
    The purpose of anxiety is to keep us safe, by making us look for and respond to danger.
    The purpose of anger is to give us the energy to fight for something important to us.
    The purpose of sadness is less obvious, but what would happen if we were born without the ability to feel
    sadness? No one would know when bad things were happening to us - because we wouldn't even know. Sadness
    motivates us to seek support, and to take some time out to process when things go wrong. Even shame
    has a purpose - it encourages us to refrain from behaviour which would have negative social repercussions.
    <br><br>
    Problems can occur when the parts of our brains which produce emotions are in conflict with
    each other. For example, when a part of our brain believes a painful emotion (such as sadness, anxiety, 
    or anger) is necessary and useful, and another part of our brain wants the suffering to stop, and
    doesn't see the emotion as useful or necessary.
    <br><br>
    Integrating these parts requires a <span class="bold">compassionate</span> exploration of each.
    Each part hinges on different emotional memories and beliefs, and each has your best interests at heart.
    It also requires us to hold multiple contradictory or painful thoughts in consciousness at once,
    without accepting or rejecting them - <span class="bold">cognitive defusion</span> helps with this. 
    <span class="bold">Mindfulness</span> helps to develop increased introspective awareness, allowing us to
    more easily notice the thoughts, memories, and emotions which previously slipped past undetected.
    <span class="bold">Gratitude</span> helps to strengthen the neural networks involved in recognising
    positive things, gradually leading to an increase in positive emotion.
