    <h3>Transdiagnostic approach</h3><br><br>
    Let's look at what mental health diagnoses are, how they are different to medical diagnoses, some reasons we might
    want to use them, and some reasons we might not want to use them.<br><br>
    
    <h3>What is a mental health diagnosis?</h3><br><br>
    
    Mental health diagnoses are described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. If a person is
    displaying symptoms consistent with a diagnosis, they can be diagnosed with a disorder.<br><br>
    
    <h3>How do they differ from medical diagnoses?</h3><br><br>
    
    Medical diagnoses usually explain the observed symptoms. For example, if you are feeling tired all of the time,
    it's really useful to know whether this is because you are sleep deprived, or because you have a virus, or because you are
    missing some important nutrients etc. A proper diagnosis lets you know what needs to be done to address the symptoms.
    Mental health diagnoses don't explain the symptoms, they are the symptoms. For example, depression doesn't cause or
    explain symptoms of depression - depression is a label given to someone who is experiencing symptoms of depression.
    There are lots of possible things that could be causing those symptoms, and lots of possible ways of addressing those
    symptoms, but the diagnosis doesn't really get into that, it just sort of says, you have these symptoms because you have
    these symptoms. Which isn't really that useful.
