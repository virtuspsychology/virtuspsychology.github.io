    Virtus is a latin word which means "moral strength", and is the etymological root of the word "virtue". Many ancient and contemporary philosophers
    thought of virtue or ethics not as following rules set by an external authority, but as qualities or actions which typically result in positive outcomes.
    <br><br>
    Conceptualising virtue in this way allows for forgiveness and self-compassion instead of judgement and shame. It also provides both a tangible reason
    to act ethically, as well as an empirical basis for determining what virtue and ethics actually are.

    However, like many things, this can become quite paradoxical. Should we strive to be nonstriving? Should we be attached to the
    idea of not being attached? Should we criticise ourselves for being self-critical? Should we stop using "shoulds"? Is it good
    to stop judging things as "good" or "bad"? Are we really accepting the present moment if we are rejecting our resistance to it?
    Very confusing.<br><br>

    That certainly seems paradoxical.
