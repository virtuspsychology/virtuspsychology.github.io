    Virtus is a latin word which means "moral strength", and is the etymological root of the word "virtue". Many ancient Greek and Roman philosophers
    thought of virtue or ethics not as following rules set by an external authority, but as qualities or actions which typically result in positive outcomes.
    <br><br>
    Conceptualising virtue in this way allows for forgiveness and self-compassion instead of judgement and shame. It also provides both a tangible reason
    to act ethically, as well as an empirical basis for determining what virtue and ethics actually are.
    <br><br>
    Our aim is to help others develop skills and habits which typically result in positive outcomes, through evidence-based therapeutic interventions and
    the latest research in psychology.
