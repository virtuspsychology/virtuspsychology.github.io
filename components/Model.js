    <h3>Summary</h3>
    Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard of therapy, and traditional CBT is
    recommended by many sources.
    However, I think it is suboptimal. I believe CBT has some helpful components,
    and some unhelpful components. This doesn't mean you can't benefit from CBT, or that any benefit you have recieved from
    CBT isn't real or valuable. I believe that the best alternative to CBT, which contains the helpful components of
    CBT without the unhelpful components, and a few additional helpful components, is Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy. The
    components I try to bring to therapy are: increased awareness, distress tolerance, self-compassion, and memory reconsolidation.
    Importantly, I do not think pathologising mental health, viewing mental processes as negative or unhelpful, or the
    practice of challenging cognitions is helpful in most situations.
    <br><br>
    <h3>What is CBT?</h3>
    Traditional CBT is based on the idea that between events and emotions, we have automatic interpretations, and that
    our emotional response is based on these interpretations, rather than the event itself. CBT generally involves uncovering
    these automatic interpretations, identifying biases in them, and challenging any biases, either with logic (the cognitive component),
    or by behaving in different ways to gather more information (the behavioural component).
    <br><br>
    <h3>What does CBT get right?</h3>
    A large component of CBT is about increasing awareness of automatic thoughts, realising that interpretations are being made,
    and behaving in different ways such that the predictions your mind makes can be updated through experience.
    All of these components are really helpful, and should be part of any therapy program.
    <br><br>
    <h3>What does CBT get wrong?</h3>
    Something which is very common in people who are struggling with mental health is the idea that they are broken or deficient
    in some way. The fact that CBT explains mental health issues as a result of cognitive biases which need to be corrected can sometimes
    feel like a confirmation of this idea. In reality, we would not be able to function without
    cognitive biases. In fact, cognitive biases are intentionally part of artificial intelligence systems, where they are called heuristics.
    The reason for this is that without heuristics, or cognitive biases, our minds would be overwhelmed with the amount of information
    which needs to be processed. Modern CBT (decribed in the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders)
    shifts emphasis from challenging distorted cognitions to something called cognitive flexibility.
    Cognitive flexibility is the ability to recognise when an interpretation is being made, as it is happening,
    and to generate other possible interpretations. Along with other changes, modern CBT appears to more closely
    resemble Acceptance and Committment Therapy (ACT) than traditional CBT.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, while I think that CBT model of emotions is valid, I don't think it's the whole picture. This can be seen in the
    case of phobias, in which a person feels intense anxiety in response to something which they don't necessarily logically believe
    is dangerous. A common complaint with traditional CBT is that people can change the way they are thinking, but this doesn't always
    change the way they are feeling. CBT attempts to address this by claiming that the belief is still there, it is just on a deeper
    level, and it can be altered through behavioural experiments. However, Occam's razor would suggest that the emotion is a result
    of classical conditioning, and any verbalised core belief would just be an interpretation of the feeling, rather than the cause
    of the feeling.
    <br><br>
    <h3>What is IFS?</h3>
    The IFS model talks about parts of the mind - as in, there is a part of me that wants to do this thing, and a part which is
    holding me back. Each part is considered to have a positive intention for you, and wants you to do something which either
    is protective, or has been protective in the past. Given that our environment is often changing, and each possible action
    has pros and cons, internal conflict is a very common occurrence and is an explicit part of the IFS model.
    As such, instead of trying to cognitively challenge and beat "negative"
    thoughts, feelings, or impulses into logical submission, we can observe them, understand them, recognise their positive
    intention for us, and feel gratitude and compassion for them. This has two helpful effects: firstly, it decreases
    activity in a region of our brain called the default mode network, which has the subjective effect of feeling like these
    thoughts, feelings, or impulses have less of a grip on us; secondly, by showing gratitude and compassion to these parts of
    ourselves, we are much more able to tolerate their existence.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Which components do CBT and IFS share?</h3>
    IFS, like CBT, assists in increasing awareness, as there is a big focus on being curious about our parts, and obseving them
    experientially in the present moment. Again, like CBT, IFS encourages people to recognise that an interpretation has been
    made, by viewing the thoughts, feelings, and impulses as being generated by a part, rather than as an objective truth.
    Finally, IFS assists in behaviour change by giving yourself some distance from your impulses, but goes further than traditional
    CBT by using imagery for the purpose of memory reconsolidation.
    <br><br>
    <h3>What other helpful components does IFS have?</h3>
    In viewing our parts as having positive intentions for us, and understanding them rather than defeating them, IFS is very
    non-pathologising/non-shaming/non-judgemental. It doesn't imply that a person's mind is deficient, but instead recognises
    that their mind is performing as it has evolved to, and is trying to keep them safe. As such, much more self-compassion
    often results from an exploration through the IFS lens, and self-compassion is a mediator of many distressing symptoms.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, operating under the assumption that the mind has parts can make it much easier to understand what is going on.
    You can explore your mind, along with any internal conflict or contradictions,
    without trying to present everything as consistent or logical.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Why question the gold standard?</h3>
    Scientific investigation into therapy effectiveness is a soft science, and things are pretty crazy at the moment.
    Psychology scientists thought that something called "ego depletion" was a real thing for almost 20 years, and thousands
    of scientific studies supported its existence. However, within the last few years, more advanced statistical techniques
    have revealed that it does not, in fact, exist - see
    <a href="https://replicationindex.com/2016/04/18/is-replicability-report-ego-depletionreplicability-report-of-165-ego-depletion-articles/" target="_blank">here</a>
    for a discussion. So, it's possible that something which doesn't exist can be shown to exist with a massive evidence base.
    Further to this, 
    <a href="resources/meta-analysis.pdf">here</a> is an article which provides evidence that psychic phenomena is real, using
    the most stringent scientific methods we have invented.
    <br><br>
    How is this possible? Experimenter expectation has a huge effect on outcome.
    <a href="resources/expectancy-effects.pdf">Here</a> is an article which looks at the effects of experimenter expectation
    in a range of different domains, and found that it plays quite a significant effect.
    <br><br>
    CBT replaced psychoanalysis with the promise of being scientifically more valid, but
    <a href="resources/cbt-analysis.pdf">here</a> is an article which demonstrates that psychoanalysis is not inferior
    to CBT. Maybe that is just experimenter expectation at work again. But, maybe CBT has such a high volume of scientific evidence
    because a therapy which involves challenging the logic of a person's thinking might appeal to the kinds of people who
    end up in academia, and so it has been studied more prolifically, with many more opportunities for experimenter expectation
    to demonstrate its efficacy.
    <br><br>
    Given the above, I think it's reasonable to question evidence-based ideas.
